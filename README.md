# Loan Approval Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict loan approval status (approved or rejected) based on personal and financial information.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Label Encoding** for binary categorical variables.
- **One-Hot Encoding** for multi-class categorical variables.
- **Standard Scaling** for numerical features.
- **Pandas Profiling** was used for **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, providing a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including missing values, correlations, and distribution of features.

## Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

## Performance Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report**

Cross-validation was used for robust performance evaluation.
